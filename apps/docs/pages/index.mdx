> ### Light is the metaverse economy.

Light aims to onboarding the next billion people to web3, through providing a mechanism to earn income through social activities. We aim to replace current social networks that are over-relient on advertisement and exploitation of personal data. Our mission is to create a world in which everyone can earn a sustainable income online, through web3 social.

## The problem

We aim to reward the rest of 99.9% of the people - the non-influencers. Currently, most of the casual viewers cannot earn income online, since traditional social networks heavily are biased towards people who have a large following. Light is going to liberate the rest of the world to gain upside.

## How do Light's products work?

Light has 3 main products including:

- Attention Economy
- Super Activities
- Team Battles

## Attention Economy

### What is Attention Protocol on Light?

[Attention Protocol](/protocol/attention) is the main incentive for users to come back to Light. Light airdrops tokens based on attention gathered through each block, directly to users that have contributed most to gathering attention.

## Super Activity

### What is Super Activity on Light?

[Super Activity](/protocol/super) is a fundamental nature of Light. Unlike traditional social networks where each activity on the internet is a mere "consumption" of personal data, we aim for them to become assets for users. We will integrate with Lens Protocol and make it possible for the following to become on-chain assets on the blockchain.

## Team Battle

### What is Team Battle on Light?

[Team Battle](/protocol/battle) is a game for teams on Light. Teams will compete against each other; the three teams with the highest super follow count will share a 100,000 $LIGHT bonus pool. We aim to become the incentive pool for supporting other creators on the platform.
