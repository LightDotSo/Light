# Controlling $LIGHT supply

## Why $LIGHT has no hard cap

There's currently no hard cap on the supply of $LIGHT token, making it an inflationary token.

> $LIGHT's primary function is to incentivize providing attention to users on web 3.0. Without block rewards, there would be much less incentive to provide attention.

So what are the other ways $LIGHT's supply is limited, to counter inflation?

## How $LIGHT supply is reduced without a hard cap

We aim to make deflation higher than emission by building deflationary mechanisms into Light's products.
The goal is for more $LIGHT to leave circulation than the amount of $LIGHT that's produced.
