# Light Protocol

## **The Light Protocol is a framework for building trustless reputation & credentials on Ethereum.**

It lets you:

- #### Deploy an NFT that represents admin rights over a certain project

<span className="protocol">_`Light Spaces`_</span>

Whichever address owns this NFT has admin privileges towards the space.

- #### Configure NFT credentials that represent contributions (<span className="protocol">_`Light Orbs`_</span>)

Whichever address that mints a certain criteria can mint these NFTs.

- #### Configure reputations and rarity for each task (<span className="protocol">_`Light Reputation`_</span>)

Whichever address that satisfies a certain criteria can mint reputation tokens that act as a value for reputation.

- #### Earn `$LXP` that represent your overall reputation of your web3 contributions

All actions taken place on the protocol are eligible for <span className="LXP">`$LXP`</span>, a general non-transferrable reputation token that represent your web3 contributions.
