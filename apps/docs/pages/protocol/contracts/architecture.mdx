# Architecture

The protocol is made up of 3 abstract contracts, 11 core contracts, 1 interaction contracts, 2 library contracts, & 2 renderer contracts.

## Abstract

- `LightOperatable`: Abstract contract to keep track of permissions.
- `LightManager`: Keeps track of reference addresses in the protocol.
- `LightUpgradeable`: Base upgradeable contract for core contracts

## Core

- `LightController`: Responsible for management of registry of contracts
- `LightCuration`: Signalize Light spaces
- `LightDeployer`: Deployer scripts for the Light protocol
- `LightEpochManager`: Manage epoch length of the protocol
- `LightOperatorStore`: Keeps track of permissions and access rights
- `LightOrb`: Logic for Light orbs
- `LightRewardsManager`: Rewards manager for Light protocol
- `LightSpace`: Logic for Light spaces
- `LightStaking`: Implementation for staking
- `LightToken`: $LIGHT token implementation
- `LightXP`: $LXP token implementation

## Interaction

- `LightCore`: Core contract for the Light protocol

## Libraries

- `BancorFormula`: Fork of bancor formula for the bonding curve
- `TokenUtils`: Common utils for tokens

# Renderer

- `LightENS`: Data source to stream ENS names on-chain
- `LightRenderer`: On-chain renderer for Light orbs
