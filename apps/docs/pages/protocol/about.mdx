# Light Protocol

## What Light Protocol is

> **The Light Protocol is a framework for building trustless reputation & credentials on Ethereum.**

Light is a decentralized protocol for building trustless reputation on Ethereum. Until now, it has been hard to visualize and understand
the social status of a person's network, or credibility directly on the blockchain. Through incentivizing all actors in the protocol
to act in beneficial of the trusted network, we aim to build a sustainable reputation system that lives on-chain.

### What can you do with reputation?

Initially, the use-cases of reputation will be confined of the following:

- On-chain credentials
- Eligible for protocol incentives
- Speculation of rewards

We aim to take things further down the line upon establishing a trusted network:

- Undercollateralized loans
- On-chain discounts and perks
- Retention based advertisement
