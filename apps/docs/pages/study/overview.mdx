# Overview

The Light protocol is a framework for building and rewarding reputation & credentials openly on Ethereum. It lets you:

## Deploy an NFT that represents admin rights over a space (Light Spaces)

Whichever address owns this NFT has admin priveleges towards the space.

## Configure NFT credentials that represent contributions (Light Orbs)

Whichever address that mints a certain criteria can mint these NFTs

## Configure reputations and rarity for each task (Light Tokens)

Whichever address that satisfies a certain critieria can mint tokens that act as reputation.

## Earn LXP that represent general reputation of your web3 contributions

All actions taken place on the protocol are eligible for $LXP, a general reputation token that represent your web3 contributions.
